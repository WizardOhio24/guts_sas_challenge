# sas_grocery_list

A flutter ap to track and remind you when your food goes off, to reduce food waste!

Digital grocery list, at the store check it off, then it goes into your “fridge” section/area.  Then it gives notifications when it expires before it does.  It also tracks what you buy.  How to find expiry date?  JSON file, or just say it’s going to expire soon.  You might have to log your expiration date for every item you buy.  Could cause more food waste, because people will throw out things at the best before.  
Just use average for now. Phone application.
Recipes which use that food, show with notifications.
